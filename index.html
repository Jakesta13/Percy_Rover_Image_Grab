    <!-- I did some poking around on https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/ and found they have a live timer, and so I looked for a script they run to update this time and it is super easy.
        I decided NOT to host this seperately, as it is not my own code, but it appears to do it's thing without causing much more load than just loading the script
        when the page is loaded.
